The new code that I tried out was placing different columns from my data set and coding them to to form histograms. These histograms help to show the frequency of the data more clearly. These histograms also make it easier to detect any gaps in the data or outliers. It also divides the possible values in the data set into classes or groups. 
The coig that finds the mean makes the number of hospitals more accurate in each area and location. This is because it groups together any places that may have been repeated in in the data or may require two rows and averages them together then finds the mean. The same goes for the mean of the icu beds, it makes the number of icu beds more accurate and specifc. The median gives us an idea of what quantity is in the middle and then we can compare the means to the medians to help see where there are more outliers and how that compares to the location and population.
